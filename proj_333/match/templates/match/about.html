                    <p>Princeton is a place brimming with interesting people with diverse interests and a good conversation is just around the corner. Even so, many people profess to lack meaningful connections with their peers. The campus often becomes divided into smaller groups and chance encounters with ridiculously cool new people are far and few in between. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>TigerMingle was created to change that: it is an app for people who want to sit with a fellow student for a cup of coffee or maybe a meal and have a good conversation. Maybe this app will facilitate lasting friendships, or it will simply create meaningful hour-long connections. The hope is that people from diverse backgrounds will get to meet each other on a meeting that otherwise would never happen. </p>
